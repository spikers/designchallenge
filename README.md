# Applican
We're here to make design challenges fair. Most companies in need of designers will issue a design challenge. Some design challenges make applicants feel cheated. In an ever-candidate-focused job market, we need to ensure that the candidates feel comfortable if companies want to attract the top talent. Enter Applican. 

Applican fixes this problem by issuing the design challenges for you and keeps all the work in one place - Easy to review, easy to continue. 

Try it today! (It's just a hackathon project, don't actually try it!)
